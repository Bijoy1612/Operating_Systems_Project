For the FIFA World Cup 2006, a fly-over has been constructed between the hotel where the teams are staying and the stadium. This fly-over will be used by the German team and the Italian team in the upcoming semi final on Tuesday. A tram car is used to cross this fly-over, but it seats only four people, and must always carry a full load. We cannot put three Italians and one German in the same tram-car, because the Italians would be in majority and might try to intimidate the German. Similarly, we cannot put three Germans in the same tram-car with one Italian. All other combinations are safe.
